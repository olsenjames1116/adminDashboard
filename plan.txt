Understanding the problem:
    The goal here is to create an admin dashboard that includes a few major sections.
    Once finished, it will appear similar to the "Holy Grail" layout.

Plan
-------
Does your program have a user interface? What will it look like? What functionality will the interface have?
    Yes. The user interface will be a dashboard with a header, sidebar, main content section and footer.
    The header will have a search bar, alert icon, user image, user name, welcome message, and navbar.
    The sidebar will have a dashboard logo and navigation to several pages within the website. 
    The main content section will have a few cards with projects the user has worked on, an announcements section and a section with trending users.
    The footer will have credits to the author as well as credit to the artists behind the images.
    The interface will have a search bar the user can type in and submit.
What inputs will your program have? Will the user enter data or will you get input from somewhere else?
    The only input the program has is in the form of the search bar which will take in data from the user.
What's the desired input?
    There desired input is text from the user.
Given your inputs, what are the steps necessary to return the desired output?
    The input will not be sent anywhere on the backend so there is no need to do anything with the input.
